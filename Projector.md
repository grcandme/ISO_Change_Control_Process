3. Testing DVD Player to TV - PASS
4. Testing DVD Player to TV via TX / RX FAIL [data sheet](https://cdn-docs.av-iq.com/dataSheet/DIGI-HDXL-S_Datasheet.pdf)
5. No HDMI connection from DVD player to transmitter. Intelix TX/Transmitter DIGI-HDXL-S has most likely failed.
6. Systems are not grounded and no cable management is present creating excessive lead time to troubleshoot system components. 
7. TX/RX are exceptionally HOT to the touch and should be mounted accordingly to reduce likelihood of component failure.

8. Key challenges or decisions to be made 
    1. Troubleshoot DVD player - PASS 
    2. Troubleshoot Intelix Transmitter - FAIL
    3. Troubleshoot Projector Display / Image - Unable to test component failure. Projector is not displaying any issues with display. It is unlikely that the projector is inoperable. There are other components that should be considered first. 

9. Discussion and brainstorming 

10. Action items or next steps
    Replace Intelix TX/Transmitter DIGI-HDXL-S 
    Troubleshoot system

# C. Topic 3: Implementation

1. Background and context
    Cable management is **NOT** present, systems and components may likely fail in the future without consideration for proper cabling, grounding and installation

2. Key challenges or decisions to be made
    There could be an "in-line" failure that is preventing successful transmission and connection between the components. This has not been tested. 

3. Discussion and brainstorming
