## About the sequence
This sequence diagram showcases the interaction between a User, Security Controls Assessor, and the Caten8 system. The User requests a security controls assessment, and the Security Controls Assessor accesses the Caten8 system to retrieve relevant data and controls information. The Security Controls Assessor then analyzes the data, identifies risks, and performs various tasks related to risk assessment and control. The Security Controls Assessor updates the assessment information in Caten8 and provides risk assessment and control recommendations to the User.
