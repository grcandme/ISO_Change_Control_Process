-   The presence of a Security Architect (SEC-ARCH) cultivates knowledgeable teams and promotes a security-first culture. This proactive approach helps identify and mitigate potential risks, ensuring business continuity even in the face of security incidents or cyber attacks.
-   Systems Architects (SYS-ARCH) streamline workflows and evolve a unified operating model, improving operational efficiency and minimizing disruptions. By optimizing systems and processes, organizations can maintain smooth operations, enabling business continuity during unforeseen events or disruptions.
-   Software Developers (SOFT-DEV) collaborate effectively across the platform, enhancing the stability and resilience of software systems. This enables organizations to continue their operations without interruptions caused by software failures or vulnerabilities.
-   Data Architects (DATA-ARCH) ensure efficient and effective data management, including proper data backup and recovery mechanisms. This safeguards critical business data and allows organizations to recover quickly in the event of data loss or system failures, preserving operational continuity.
-   Enterprise Architects (ENT-ARCH) align business objectives with hybrid cloud operations, enabling organizations to leverage cloud technologies for enhanced scalability, flexibility, and resilience. This ensures that the organization's operations can continue smoothly, even during infrastructure disruptions or outages.
-   The Trouble Ticket Mapping System enables efficient incident response and resolution. By promptly tracking, assigning, and resolving tickets, organizations can mitigate the impact of incidents and maintain operational continuity.
-   The framework maps primary work roles to specific responsibilities and emphasizes the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) necessary for each role. This ensures that organizations have well-rounded expertise and capabilities to handle various operational challenges, maintain continuity, and recover quickly from disruptions.
-   The Relationship Mapping demonstrates the alignment of roles and responsibilities, ensuring that all aspects of the organization's operations and security are addressed. This comprehensive approach enhances operational resilience, enabling organizations to withstand disruptions and continue their activities.
-   By implementing security controls, conducting regular assessments, and involving key stakeholders such as Information System Owners (ISOs), Authorizing Officials (AOs), and Chief Information Officers (CIOs), the framework ensures oversight, development, and secure provisioning of information systems. This contributes to operational resilience and enables organizations to adapt to evolving threats and challenges.
-   Roles such as System Administrators (SYS_ADMIN), Network Administrators (NET_ADMIN), Database Administrators (DB_ADMIN), and other roles associated with operating and maintaining systems play a vital role in ensuring continuous availability and resilience of IT infrastructure.
-   Incident Responders (INC_RESP), Threat Analysts (THREAT_ANALYST), and other related roles focus on protecting and defending the organization's systems and networks. Their expertise and quick response to incidents contribute to maintaining operational continuity and resilience.
